#  **Pandas Challenge 1**
### By: Kyle Kerner

In this program we take a provided data set and explore the contents of the data.  From there we transform the data to get the necessary data that we want to handle in this given instance finding the top five clients.  After getting the top five clients based on units purchased we confirmed that we were able to properly transform the data and then draw conclusions based on our findings from transforming the data.
